# magpieCTF 2022 - Turn Key Writeup
By: Nectarios Chroniaris

## Preamble

The intended solve, as documented on [magpieCTF's public GitHub repo](https://github.com/infosec-ucalgary/magpieCTF2022-public/tree/main/challenges/networks/turn-key), involves renting/using servers that are physically close to the vaults, in order to get each request to complete in the required 300 or so milliseconds.

However, by taking some clever shortcuts in the design of the protocol, we can reduce round-trip delays and otherwise unnecessary overhead, to squeeze the total delay under the required amount (yes, even for the server in Bangalore!).
